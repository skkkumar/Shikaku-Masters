Shikaku
=======

Constraint Satisfaction Problem solved by brute force and with heuristics

I have used java version 7 u09. Using some other version, especially lower version may throw compilation and run time errors.

Shikaku
===============================

Sample input files are given in "input_for_shikaku" folder. In case, you want to try your own grid, please copy one of the files and modify it properly. The first two integers are size of the grid so in case you change the size of the grid, please do change those values or else the code will not work.

Try run shikaku on input file (after compiling source code):

1. java -jar ShikakuCSP.jar <path of the input file>

e.g. java -jar ShikakuCSP.jar input_for_shikaku/grid01

2. java -jar ShikakuMinValCSP.jar <path of the input file>

java -jar ShikakuMinValCSP.jar input_for_shikaku/grid01
